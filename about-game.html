      <p>This game is the result of the 
        final project of the first module 
        of Ironhack's Web Developer course.
        
        It was created using html, css and 
        the javascript programming language.

        It's based on a classic scene from the 
        famous American TV series The Office, 
        where Kevin Malone is trying to get to 
        the office with his chili pan safe and sound.

        Hope you enjoy this simple and fun game!</p>
